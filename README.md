# NPM Scripts
> Nuggets on why & how to use NPM Scripts as your primary build tool.

The Node Package Manager and the package.json file in combination makes a great option for build automation.
Using NPM and package.json is simpler and has no extra dependencies such as Gulp and Grunt for example. Often Gulp and Grunt are unnecessary abstractions. NPM scripts are plenty powerful and often easier to live with.

Use this as a quick reference or cheat sheet.

# Why NPM Scripts
* JavaScript all the things.
* Cut down on dependencies.
* Use any NPM script (Remember to ```—save-dev```).
* Always up to date.
* Remove dependence on plugin authors.
* Less code to debug.
* No need to lean plugins
* Avoid frustrating debugging

# Common misconceptions
*  NPM scripts require strong command line skills.
*  NPM scripts aren’t powerful enough.
*  Gulp’s streams are necessary for fast builds.
*  NPM scripts don’t run cross platform.

# Package.json
You define all your scripts in the ```package.json``` file.
If you don’t already have it, read below.

### Get Started
```bash  
$ npm init  
```

### Example
The following is an example of a fill package.json file. You define scripts as children in the ```scripts``` object.
```json
{
  "name": "npm-scripts-as-build-tool",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Example package.json file",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Running test script\"",
    "start": "echo \"Running start script\"",
    "stop": "echo \"Running stop script\"",
    "restart": "echo \"Running restart script\"",

    "start:dev": "echo \"My dev script\""
  },
  "author": "Terkel Gjervig",
  "license": "MIT",
  "keywords": [
    "npm",
    "scripting"
  ]
}
```

# Invoke commands
NPM provides a couple of shorthands for invoking commands.
To list all commands in package.json run ```npm run```
```bash
# Start shorthand
$ npm start

# Test shorthands
$ npm test
$ npm tst
$ npm t

# Start and restart
$ npm stop
$ npm restart

# Everything else
$ npm run myscript
```
If you haven't defined ```npm restart```, NPM  will run stop and then start.

# Pre-  and Post  hooks
You can run pre and post hooks before and after a script.
A hook is just another script, prefixed with *pre* or *post*.
Hooks are just like any other scripts, and you can run them directly with ```npm run premyscript```.  
The order in which you define hooks doesn't matter.
```json
  "scripts": {
    "premyscript": "echo \"Pre script\"",
    "myscript": "echo \"Running script\"",
    "postmyscript": "echo \"Running post script\""
  },
```

You can’t override the behaviours for the internal commands, like ```npm publish```, but you can affect their behaviour with pre- and post- scripts. This means you can do stuff like:
```json
"scripts": {
  "prepublish": "echo \"I run before npm publish\""
}
```

# Chaning
With NPM scripts it’s possible to chain commands, just as you do with Gulp and Grunt. NPM scripts is basically just shell commands you invoke through ```NPM run```, which means you can use all your favourite shell operators. 

### Ampersand Operator: Parallel commands
You can also use the ```&``` operator to run two commands at the same time on Unix
```bash
npm run script1.js & npm run script2.js
```

You can also use [Parallelshell](https://github.com/keithamus/parallelshell) to run commands in parallel - cross platform.

### The Logical AND Operator *(&&)*
```A && B –– Run B only if A succeeded```

Chaining commands (*Waits for each command to finish successfully before starting the next*) is possible with the ```&&``` operator. This is very similar to ```pre-``` or ```post-``` hooks.

The AND Operator would execute the second command only, if the execution of first command succeeds.

### The Logical OR Operator *(||)*
```A || B –– Run B only if A failed```

Execute a second command only if the first command does not succeed.

### The Semicolon Operator *(;)*
```A ; B –– Run A and then B, regardless of the success or failure of A```

The semicolon operator allows you to execute multiple commands in succession, regardless of whether each previous command succeeds.

### Pipe Operator *(|)*
This ```|``` operator is very useful where the output of first command acts as an input to the second command.

### Output Operator
```>``` Output to file
```bash
grep 'John Doe' bigFileWithNames.txt > linesWithJohnDoe.txt
```

# Complex Scripts
Decompose big problems by calling one script from another.
Use ```&&``` to call multiple scripts serially on a single line.
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "clean": "rimraf ./dist && mkdir dist",
    "prebuild": "npm run clean",
    "build": "cross-env NODE_ENV=production webpack"
  }
}
```

If a command gets too complicated, you can always call a separate file
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "node build.js"
  }
}
```

# Streams
You don’t need Gulp for streams. Streaming has always been built into both Unix and Windows command lines. The pipe ```|``` operator streams the output of one command to the input of another command. And the redirection ```>``` operator redirects output to a file.

# Cross-platform
Here’s some of the cross-platform commands:
```bash
&&  # chain tasks (Run one task after another)
<   # input file contents to a command
>   # redirect command output to a file
|   # redirect command output to another command
```

You can also use node packages instead of shell commands. 
For example use the package ```rimraf``` instead of ```rm -rf``` or use ```cross-env``` to set environment variables in a cross-platform way.
Find modules by searching Google, NPM or take a look at libraries.io.

Last but not least, you can use [shelljs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/shelljs) for portable Unix shell commands.

# NPM Config Variables

[coming]

# Version Bumping
npm version - shows current version
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "version:major": "npm version major",
    "version:minor": "npm version minor",
    "version:patch": "npm version patch"
  }
}
```

#### Notes
Use the ```npm -s``` flag to silence npm's output from the subtasks, which makes the log output a little tidier (it is a shortcut for --loglevel=silent:
https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/config#default-configs).
